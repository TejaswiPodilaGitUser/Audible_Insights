The Bhagavad Gita,Eknath Easwaran,4.7,1988.0,280.0,"The Bhagavad Gita, The Song of the Lord, is the best known of all the Indian scriptures, and Easwarans reliable and accessible version has consistently been the bestselling translation. Easwarans introduction places the Gita in its historical setting and brings out the universality and timelessness of its teachings. Chapter introductions give clear explanations of key concepts in that chapter. To listen to the scripture without the introductions, listeners should start at track 044. The Bhagavad Gita opens dramatically on a battlefield, as the warrior Arjuna turns in anguish to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, for answers to the fundamental questions of life. But as Easwaran points out, the Gita is not what it seems  its not a dialogue between two mythical figures at the dawn of Indian history. The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gitas subject is the war within, the struggle for selfmastery that every human being must wage to live a life that is meaningful, fulfilling, and worthwhile.

Badi Soch Ka Bada Jadu [The Magic of Thinking Big],David Schwartz,4.5,805.0,836.0,"Badi Shoch Ka Bada Jadu is the Hindi translation of David J. Schwartzs best seller The Magic of Thinking Big. The authors point of view is that thinking big is the way to success, that is, thinking positively about oneself. The main stumbling block that prevents many people from succeeding in their life is the smallness or inconsequential nature of their thoughts. Schwartz tries to prove that it is not necessary to have an inherent talent or be an intellectual for attaining success, but there is a need for a person to understand and learn the habit of behaving and thinking in ways by which he or she can reach the top. His book begins with the story of a salesman who is able to sell more, and make more money than his cosalesmen. He is not highly qualified, influential, or smarter than his friends. However, he just decides that he should sell more and eventually he achieves what he wants.",691,",#275 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#59 in Personal Success,#813 in Personal Development & Self-Help"

The Silk Roads: A New History of the World,Peter Frankopan,4.6,1775.0,1338.0,"The sun is setting on the Western world. Slowly but surely, the direction in which the world spins has reversed where for the last five centuries the globe turned westward on its axis, it now turns to the east.... For centuries fame and fortune were to be found in the West  in the New World of the Americas. Today it is the East that calls out to those in search of adventure and riches. The region stretching from Eastern Europe and sweeping right across Central Asia, deep into China and India, is taking center stage in international politics, commerce, and culture  and is shaping the modern world. This region, the true center of the Earth, is obscure to many in the Englishspeaking world. Yet this is where civilization itself began, where the worlds great religions were born and took root. The Silk Roads were no exotic series of connections but networks that linked continents and oceans together. Along them flowed ideas, goods, disease, and death. This was where empires were won  and where they were lost. As a new era emerges, the patterns of exchange are mirroring those that have crisscrossed Asia for millennia. The Silk Roads are rising again. A major reassessment of world history, The Silk Roads is an important account of the forces that have shaped the global economy and the political renaissance in the reemerging East.",1454,",#665 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#6 in History of Civilization,#28 in History of Civilization & Culture,#7,083 in Textbooks & Study Guides"

After introducing the openfocus technique, he then moves you into the practice of finding the present moment. When you discover the sweet spot of the present moment and you forget about yourself as the personality you have always been, you have access to other possibilities that already exist in the quantum field.

In the present moment, the familiar past and the future literally no longer exist, and you become pure consciousness  a thought alone. That is the moment that you can change your body, change your environment, and even create a new timeline for your life",55,Body & Spirit

We wait for hope, for healing, and for miracles. We wait on God. And when we misunderstand what waiting is about, we can get confused about what God is up to. Waiting is one of Gods favorite tools. He can do certain things in our hearts, our lives, and our relationships while we wait  things we cannot experience once weve opened the gift we have been waiting for. So just you wait, because everyone takes their turn in the waiting room. Its a long and painful fact of life, but shortcuts and microwaves arent the answer. God is at work behind the scenes in invisible ways you cant see...yet. Just you wait and see how ready youll be if you spend your waiting well. Because when your opportunity comes, you dont want to spend more time on the bench. When you wait well, you can say, Look out, world I am getting ready to shine. Just you wait. In this audiobook, Tricia discusses the joy hidden in the discipline of waiting, and the practices of believing God is for you and working on your behalf, even when the work of His hand is hard to find.",296,",#3,044 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#3 in Christian Death & Grief,#4 in Women's Christian Living,#20 in Christian Spiritual Growth"

What happens when ordinary people are taught a system to make extraordinary money Richard Dennis made a fortune on Wall Street by investing according to a few simple rules.

For two weeks, Dennis taught them his investment rules and philosophy, and set them loose to start trading, each with a million dollars of his money. By the time the experiment ended, Dennis had made 100,000,000 from his Turtles and created one killer Wall Street legend. In The Complete Turtle Trader, Michael W.

Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crises,James Rickards,4.5,770.0,738.0,"In 1971, President Nixon imposed national price controls and took the United States off the gold standard, an extreme measure intended to end an ongoing currency war that had destroyed faith in the U.S. dollar. Today we are engaged in a new currency war, and this time the consequences will be far worse than those that confronted Nixon. Currency wars are one of the most destructive and feared outcomes in international economics. At best, they offer the sorry spectacle of countries stealing growth from their trading partners. At worst, they degenerate into sequential bouts of inflation, recession, retaliation, and sometimes actual violence. Left unchecked, the next currency war could lead to a crisis worse than the panic of 2008.Currency wars have happened beforetwice in the last century aloneand they always end badly. Time and again, paper currencies have collapsed, assets have been frozen, gold has been confiscated, and capital controls have been imposed. And the next crash is overdue. Recent headlines about the debasement of the dollar, bailouts in Greece and Ireland, and Chinese currency manipulation are all indicators of the growing conflict.As James Rickards argues in Currency Wars, this is more than just a concern for economists and investors. The United States is facing serious threats to its national security, from clandestine gold purchases by China to the hidden agendas of sovereign wealth funds. Greater than any single threat is the very real danger of the collapse of the dollar itself.Baffling to many observers is the rank failure of economists to foresee or prevent the economic catastrophes of recent years. Not only have their theories failed to prevent calamity, they are making the currency wars worse. The U. S. Federal Reserve has engaged in the greatest gamble in the history of finance, a sustained effort to stimulate the economy by printing money on a trilliondollar scale. Its solutions present hidden new dangers while resolving none of the current dilemmas. While the outcome of the new currency war is not yet certain, some version of the worstcase scenario is almost inevitable if U.S. and world economic leaders fail to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors.",592,",#4,561 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#142 in Economics (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#2,067 in Economics Books,#52,973 in Textbooks & Study Guides"

"The Laws of Simplicity: Design, Technology, Business, LifeDesign, Technology, Business, Life",John Maeda,4.1,108.0,469.0,"Finally, we are learning that simplicity equals sanity. Were rebelling against technology thats too complicated, DVD players with too many menus, and software accompanied by 75megabyte read me manuals. The iPods clean gadgetry has made simplicity hip. But sometimes we nd ourselves caught up in the simplicity paradox we want something thats simple and easy to use, but also does all the complex things we might ever want it to do. In The Laws of Simplicity, John Maeda offers ten laws for balancing simplicity and complexity in business, technology, and design  guidelines for needing less and actually getting more. Maeda  a professor in MITs Media Lab and a worldrenowned graphic designer  explores the question of how we can redene the notion of improved so that it doesnt always mean something more, something added on. Maedas rst law of simplicity is reduce. Its not necessarily benecial to add technology features just because we can. And the features that we do have must be organized Law 2 in a sensible hierarchy so users arent distracted by features and functions they dont need. But simplicity is not less just for the sake of less. Skip ahead to Law 9 failure Some things can never be made simple. Maedas concise guide to simplicity in the digital age shows us how this idea can be a cornerstone of organizations and their products  how it can drive both business and technology. We can learn to simplify without sacricing comfort and meaning, and we can achieve the balance described in Law 10. This law, which Maeda calls the one, tells us Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.",164,",#4,444 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#1 in Graphic Design,#7 in Industrial Engineering (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#127 in Business Careers"

The evidence was gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and the authors subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.

Creating Great Choices: A Leader's Guide to Integrative Thinking,Jennifer Riel,4.7,35.0,703.0,"A practical fourstep methodology for any leader or manager facing a tough choice, and for creating integrative solutions to big, complex, and pressing problems. Conventional wisdom  and business school curricula  teaches us that making tradeoffs is inevitable when it comes to hard choices. But sometimes, accepting the obvious tradeoff just isnt good enough the choices in front of us dont get us what we need. In those cases, rather than choosing the least worst option, we can use the models in front of us to create a new and better answer. This is integrative thinking. First introduced by Roger Martin in The Opposable Mind, integrative thinking is an approach to problem solving that uses opposing ideas as the basis for innovation. Now, in Creating Great Choices, Martin and fellow Rotman expert Jennifer Riel vividly show how they have refined and enhanced the understanding and practice of integrative thinking through their work teaching the concept and its principles to business and nonprofit executives, MBA students, even kids. Integrative thinking has been embraced by organizations such as Procter  Gamble, Deloitte, Verizon, and the Toronto District School Board  all seeking a replicable, thoughtful approach to creating a third and better way to make important choices in the face of unacceptable tradeoffs. The book includes new stories of successful integrative thinkers that will demystify the process of creative problem solving. It lays out the authors practical fourstep methodology, which can be applied in virtually any context",0,-1

It draws on data collected by companies, universities, and governments in Australia, India, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, Zambia, and other countries, often in randomized controlled trials. It points out dozens of evidencebased interventions that could be adopted right now and demonstrates how research is addressing gender bias, improving lives and performance.
