The Bhagavad Gita,Eknath Easwaran,"The Bhagavad Gita, The Song of the Lord, is the best known of all the Indian scriptures, and Easwarans reliable and accessible version has consistently been the bestselling translation. Easwarans introduction places the Gita in its historical setting and brings out the universality and timelessness of its teachings. Chapter introductions give clear explanations of key concepts in that chapter. To listen to the scripture without the introductions, listeners should start at track 044. The Bhagavad Gita opens dramatically on a battlefield, as the warrior Arjuna turns in anguish to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, for answers to the fundamental questions of life. But as Easwaran points out, the Gita is not what it seems  its not a dialogue between two mythical figures at the dawn of Indian history. The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gitas subject is the war within, the struggle for selfmastery that every human being must wage to live a life that is meaningful, fulfilling, and worthwhile. This audio recording is a complete and unabridged reading of Eknath Easwarans book The Bhagavad Gita.",0,-1

For centuries fame and fortune were to be found in the West  in the New World of the Americas. Today it is the East that calls out to those in search of adventure and riches. The region stretching from Eastern Europe and sweeping right across Central Asia, deep into China and India, is taking center stage in international politics, commerce, and culture  and is shaping the modern world. This region, the true center of the Earth, is obscure to many in the Englishspeaking world. Yet this is where civilization itself began, where the worlds great religions were born and took root. The Silk Roads were no exotic series of connections but networks that linked continents and oceans together. Along them flowed ideas, goods, disease, and death. This was where empires were won  and where they were lost. As a new era emerges, the patterns of exchange are mirroring those that have crisscrossed Asia for millennia. The Silk Roads are rising again.

What happens when ordinary people are taught a system to make extraordinary money Richard Dennis made a fortune on Wall Street by investing according to a few simple rules.

For two weeks, Dennis taught them his investment rules and philosophy, and set them loose to start trading, each with a million dollars of his money. By the time the experiment ended, Dennis had made 100,000,000 from his Turtles and created one killer Wall Street legend. In The Complete Turtle Trader, Michael W.

If you have a web site, you are a publisher. If you are on social media, you are in marketing. And that means that we are all relying on our words to carry our marketing messages. We are all writers. Yeah, but who cares about writing anymore In a timechallenged world dominated by short and snappy, by clickbait headlines and Twitter streams and Instagram feeds and gifs and video and Snapchat and YOLO and LOL and tbt... does the idea of focusing on writing seem pedantic and ordinary Actually, writing matters more now, not less. Our online words are our currency they tell our customers who we are. Our writing can make us look smart or it can make us look stupid. It can make us seem fun, or warm, or competent, or trustworthy. But it can also make us seem humdrum or discombobulated or flatout boring. That means youve got to choose words well, and write with economy and the style and honest empathy for your customers. And it means you put a new value on an oftenoverlooked skill in content marketing How to write, and how to tell a true story really, really well.

"Just. You. Wait.: Patience, Contentment, and Hope for the Everyday",Tricia Lott Williford,"Everybody waits. We wait for a spouse, wait for a baby, wait on our children, wait for our parents. We wait for clarity and direction. We wait on a job, a promotion, a new direction. We wait for hope, for healing, and for miracles. We wait on God. And when we misunderstand what waiting is about, we can get confused about what God is up to. Waiting is one of Gods favorite tools. He can do certain things in our hearts, our lives, and our relationships while we wait  things we cannot experience once weve opened the gift we have been waiting for. So just you wait, because everyone takes their turn in the waiting room. Its a long and painful fact of life, but shortcuts and microwaves arent the answer. God is at work behind the scenes in invisible ways you cant see...yet. Just you wait and see how ready youll be if you spend your waiting well. Because when your opportunity comes, you dont want to spend more time on the bench. When you wait well, you can say, Look out, world I am getting ready to shine. Just you wait. In this audiobook, Tricia discusses the joy hidden in the discipline of waiting, and the practices of believing God is for you and working on your behalf, even when the work of His hand is hard to find.",296,",#3,044 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#3 in Christian Death & Grief,#4 in Women's Christian Living,#20 in Christian Spiritual Growth"

Said is best known for describing and critiquing Orientalism, which he perceived as a constellation of false assumptions underlying Western attitudes toward the East. In Orientalism Said claimed a subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against AraboIslamic peoples and their culture. He argued that a long tradition of false and romanticized images of Asia and the Middle East in Western culture had served as an implicit justification for Europe and the US colonial and imperial ambitions. Just as fiercely, he denounced the practice of Arab elites who internalized the US and British orientalists ideas of Arabic culture.

Judgement Detox: Release the Beliefs That Hold You Back from Living a Better Life,Gabrielle Bernstein,"Judgement  both being judged and judging others  is at the core of our discomfort and the root of many of our life blocks. When we judge others, we get a quick hit of selfrighteousness. Judgement can get us through when we feel hurt, insecure, or vulnerable. But inevitably this feeling of righteousness fades and judgement causes our energy to weaken and our thoughts to darken. Spiritual thought leader Gabrielle Bernstein made the commitment to heal her own relationship to judgement and changed her life in profound ways. She found that becoming more aware of her judgements made her a more mindful and conscious person. Her willingness to revise these perceptions has set her free. Here Gabrielle shares the process she used to liberate herself  a sixstep interactive programme that calls on spiritual principles from A Course in Miracles, Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and other metaphysical and healing teachings.

But sometimes we nd ourselves caught up in the simplicity paradox we want something thats simple and easy to use, but also does all the complex things we might ever want it to do. In The Laws of Simplicity, John Maeda offers ten laws for balancing simplicity and complexity in business, technology, and design  guidelines for needing less and actually getting more. Maeda  a professor in MITs Media Lab and a worldrenowned graphic designer  explores the question of how we can redene the notion of improved so that it doesnt always mean something more, something added on. Maedas rst law of simplicity is reduce. Its not necessarily benecial to add technology features just because we can. And the features that we do have must be organized Law 2 in a sensible hierarchy so users arent distracted by features and functions they dont need. But simplicity is not less just for the sake of less. Skip ahead to Law 9 failure Some things can never be made simple. Maedas concise guide to simplicity in the digital age shows us how this idea can be a cornerstone of organizations and their products  how it can drive both business and technology. We can learn to simplify without sacricing comfort and meaning, and we can achieve the balance described in Law 10. This law, which Maeda calls the one, tells us Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious, and adding the meaningful.",164,",#4,444 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#1 in Graphic Design,#7 in Industrial Engineering (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#127 in Business Careers"

On the Origin of Species: By Means of Natural Selection,Charles Darwin,"On the Origin of Species 1859 by Charles Darwin is a work of scientific literature considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. The book introduced the theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection, backed by a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. The evidence was gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and the authors subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation. Darwins theory that species derive from other species by a gradual evolutionary process and that the average level of each species is heightened by the survival of the fittest stirred controversy and opposition. Darwins concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection has become the unifying concept of the life sciences.",965,",#4,450 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#17 in Evolution,#21 in Biology (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#1,166 in Biology Books"

Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crises,James Rickards,"In 1971, President Nixon imposed national price controls and took the United States off the gold standard, an extreme measure intended to end an ongoing currency war that had destroyed faith in the U.S. dollar. Today we are engaged in a new currency war, and this time the consequences will be far worse than those that confronted Nixon. Currency wars are one of the most destructive and feared outcomes in international economics. At best, they offer the sorry spectacle of countries stealing growth from their trading partners. At worst, they degenerate into sequential bouts of inflation, recession, retaliation, and sometimes actual violence. Left unchecked, the next currency war could lead to a crisis worse than the panic of 2008.Currency wars have happened beforetwice in the last century aloneand they always end badly. Time and again, paper currencies have collapsed, assets have been frozen, gold has been confiscated, and capital controls have been imposed. And the next crash is overdue. Recent headlines about the debasement of the dollar, bailouts in Greece and Ireland, and Chinese currency manipulation are all indicators of the growing conflict.As James Rickards argues in Currency Wars, this is more than just a concern for economists and investors. The United States is facing serious threats to its national security, from clandestine gold purchases by China to the hidden agendas of sovereign wealth funds. Greater than any single threat is the very real danger of the collapse of the dollar itself.Baffling to many observers is the rank failure of economists to foresee or prevent the economic catastrophes of recent years. Not only have their theories failed to prevent calamity, they are making the currency wars worse. The U. S. Federal Reserve has engaged in the greatest gamble in the history of finance, a sustained effort to stimulate the economy by printing money on a trilliondollar scale. Its solutions present hidden new dangers while resolving none of the current dilemmas. While the outcome of the new currency war is not yet certain, some version of the worstcase scenario is almost inevitable if U.S. and world economic leaders fail to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors.",592,",#4,561 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#142 in Economics (Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#2,067 in Economics Books,#52,973 in Textbooks & Study Guides"

"Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body",Daniel Goleman,"Two New York Times bestselling authors unveil new research showing what meditation can really do for the brain. In the last 20 years, meditation and mindfulness have gone from being kind of cool to becoming an omnipresent BandAid for fixing everything from your weight to your relationship to your achievement level. Unveiling here the kind of cuttingedge research that has made them giants in their fields, Daniel Goleman and Richard J Davidson show us the truth about what meditation can really do for us, as well as exactly how to get the most out of it. Sweeping away common misconceptions and neuromythology to open listeners eyes to the ways data has been distorted to sell mindtraining methods, the authors demonstrate that beyond the pleasant states mental exercises can produce, the real payoffs are the lasting personality traits that can result. But short daily doses will not get us to the highest level of lasting positive change  even if we continue for years  without specific additions. More than sheer hours, we need smart practice, including crucial ingredients such as targeted feedback from a master teacher and a more spacious, less attached view of the self, all of which are missing in widespread versions of mind training. The authors also reveal the latest data from Davidsons own lab that point to a new methodology for developing a broader array of mindtraining methods with larger implications for how we can derive the greatest benefits from the practice. Exciting, compelling, and grounded in new research, this is one of those rare books that has the power to change us at the deepest level.",548,",#5,043 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals (See Top 100 in Audible Audiobooks & Originals),#43 in Neuroscience & Neuropsychology,#96 in Biological Sciences,#118 in Meditation (Audible Audiobooks & Originals)"

The Enchiridion,Epictetus,"The Enchiridion is a collection of the most profound teachings of Epictetus c. 55135 AD, who taught that philosophy is a way of life and not just a matter of theory. The Enchiridion is a canonical text of Stoic philosophy, and contains all the fundamentals. Among them is the principle of not being concerned with that which is out of ones control. Misfortune should not disturb the individual at all, and should not be perceived negatively. Epictetus teaches that the only genuine value exists in virtuous action and accepting everything that happens in the world. He believed that one should do what is right and remain indifferent to criticism. Epictetus was highly regarded by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the early Christian philosopher Origen, and the NeoPlatonist Simplicius of Cilicia, among others. His philosophy features in popular novels like A Man in Full by Tom Wolfe and A House for Mr Biswas by V.S. Naipaul.",0,-1

Creating Great Choices: A Leader's Guide to Integrative Thinking,Jennifer Riel,"A practical fourstep methodology for any leader or manager facing a tough choice, and for creating integrative solutions to big, complex, and pressing problems. Conventional wisdom  and business school curricula  teaches us that making tradeoffs is inevitable when it comes to hard choices. But sometimes, accepting the obvious tradeoff just isnt good enough the choices in front of us dont get us what we need. In those cases, rather than choosing the least worst option, we can use the models in front of us to create a new and better answer. This is integrative thinking. First introduced by Roger Martin in The Opposable Mind, integrative thinking is an approach to problem solving that uses opposing ideas as the basis for innovation. Now, in Creating Great Choices, Martin and fellow Rotman expert Jennifer Riel vividly show how they have refined and enhanced the understanding and practice of integrative thinking through their work teaching the concept and its principles to business and nonprofit executives, MBA students, even kids. Integrative thinking has been embraced by organizations such as Procter  Gamble, Deloitte, Verizon, and the Toronto District School Board  all seeking a replicable, thoughtful approach to creating a third and better way to make important choices in the face of unacceptable tradeoffs. The book includes new stories of successful integrative thinkers that will demystify the process of creative problem solving. It lays out the authors practical fourstep methodology, which can be applied in virtually any context",0,-1

Such familiar notions as delayed gratification, the basics, or even right answers, are all incapacitating myths which Langer explodes one by one. She replaces them with her concept of mindful or conditional learning which she demonstrates, with fascinating examples from her research, to be extraordinarily effective.",0,-1

What Works: Gender Equality by Design,Iris Bohnet,"Gender equality is a moral and a business imperative. But unconscious bias holds us back, and debiasing peoples minds has proven to be difficult and expensive. Diversity training programs have had limited success, and individual effort alone often invites backlash. Behavioral design offers a new solution. By debiasing organizations instead of individuals, we can make smart changes that have big impacts. Presenting researchbased solutions, Iris Bohnet hands us the tools we need to move the needle in classrooms and boardrooms, in hiring and promotion, benefiting businesses, governments, and the lives of millions. What Works is built on new insights into the human mind. It draws on data collected by companies, universities, and governments in Australia, India, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, Zambia, and other countries, often in randomized controlled trials. It points out dozens of evidencebased interventions that could be adopted right now and demonstrates how research is addressing gender bias, improving lives and performance. What Works shows what more can be done  often at shockingly low cost and surprisingly high speed.",0,-1
